Later Edit && Final Commit: 

I have a lot of things to explain here as conclusions. 


I'll be honest, the interview test was easy, I can say easier than I expected.
So, it took for me like 3 hours to write the entire functionality and the design. 
I just tried to keep the design simple and on point with the mock up from email. Beside this, I created a "carousel" without any libraries because I use an old version of Angular on my Personal Computer and I received hundred of errors trying to install libraries. 
I used window.innerWidth and @media because I wanted to show you I know to use both versions. Beside this, I didn't paid attention to unit tests. 
The mock up link from Email didn't work, so I created a new mock up link attached in project with some duplicate items!
About the commits order and commits messages:
-> As I said above, I handled a lot of errors, so I tried to move on another laptop but with no success! I just commited & pushed the changes directly from local without any filters! 
We can discuss the projects and improvements because I know what can I do better, but I need more time and probably a better environment (my bad, I know). 

Thanks for patience! Have a good day!
